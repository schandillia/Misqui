## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **User Authentication**

   - All user authentication is handled through NextAuth.js

   - Session management with secure token handling

2. **API Security**

   - All API endpoints are protected with proper authentication
   - Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks
   - Input validation is performed on all endpoints
   - CORS policies are strictly enforced

3. **Database Security**
   - All database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection
   - Database credentials are stored in environment variables
   - Regular security audits of database access patterns
   - Proper indexing to prevent timing attacks

### Data Protection

1. **User Data**

   - Personal information is encrypted at rest
   - Data is encrypted in transit using TLS

1. **Server Security**

   - Regular security updates and patches
   - Firewall configuration
   - Intrusion detection systems
   - Regular security scanning

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regular updates of npm packages
   - Security scanning of dependencies
   - Lock file integrity checks
   - Version pinning for critical packages

## Best Practices

   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor for suspicious activities

3. **API Development**
   - Implement proper validation
   - Use rate limiting
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow REST security best practices

### For Users

1. **Account Security**

   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Regularly review account activity
   - Report suspicious activities

2. **Data Protection**
   - Don't share account credentials
   - Log out after each session
